# Notes

## Stacks and queues

**Amortized analysis**: Average running time per operation over a worst-case sequence of operations.

### Linked-list implementations.
* Every operations takes constant time in the worst case.
* Uses extra time and space to deal with the links

### Resizing-array implementation.
* Every operation takes constant amortized time.
* Less wasted space.
